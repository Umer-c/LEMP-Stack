# LEMP-Stack
LEMP stack project with Horizontal scaling

In this project we will be deploying 5 servers seperately. I have vagrant to create these ubuntu servers. Nginx server will be searving as loadbalancer having ip hash active for persistant sessions for the users. On the other side we have two wordpress servers connected with another backend db server. Here is an overview of the stack.
